## Project 2!

Similar to the lab of the last class, with the exception of this being a solo class, you will be doing the following:

1. Decide what API you want to call
1. Set up the basic env. Think a folder with an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, and a `main.js` file that the html calls. In the last class I set up the `starter` golder with the three files. Feel free to copy those as a starting setup so you can see the console printing a statement, therefor knowing your 3 files are hooked up.
1. Research what the data will look like coming to you, and plan how you want to present the data (estimate, things always change!)
1. Setup the call
1. Use the data
1. Visual polish
