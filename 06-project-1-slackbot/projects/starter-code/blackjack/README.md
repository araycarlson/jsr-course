# Rules to Blackjack

If a player’s cards add up to more than 21, then she is bust and must start again. The game is over.

If a player’s cards add up to exactly 21, then she has a blackjack, and the game is over.

If a player’s cards add up to 21 or less, but she has already been dealt five cards, then the game is over, and she wins.

Otherwise, the player can choose to get another card or stop playing.
