## Lab Explanation?

We are going to be getting in small groups and working towards making a simple API call and displaying it in the client. **This will be as a practice for the Project 2 day, where you will be doing this on your own**. The reason we are doing this today is so I can pair stronger HTML/CSS students with those not as confident, and everyone can practice the concept of `using an API, calling the data, doing something with the data`. Zach and Cary will provide 5 API's that you will choose from, and the general process each team will want to follow is this:

1. Decide what API you want to call. This won't be kept and will essentially be a throwaway lab, so don't feel like you are a SCOTUS arguing for the future of a country. Keep it simple.
1. Decide who will want to share screen. (1 person will share their screen and the others will watch, then the files will be sent to everyone in the group once it is completed).
1. Set up the basic env. Think a folder with an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, and a `main.js` file that the html calls.I have provided in a `starter` folder within this directory the 3 files with very basic content, which has the HTML imported **JUST** the CSS and JavasCript files.
1. Research what the data will look like coming to you, and plan how you want to present the data (estimate, things always change!)
1. Setup the call
1. Use the data
1. Polish the abomination of a website you have created. JK
